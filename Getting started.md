I don't think that my art journey has been the most efficient one.
But during these years, I've found some very useful sources.

This is the best channel I have stumbled upon in YouTube, [Love Life Drawing - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@lovelifedrawing/videos).

It is also important to find specific artists that inspire you, but in the beginning you do not need to force it. For me, these were the artists that really influenced the way I work with my pieces:

- [Bryn Geronimo Jones](https://www.artstation.com/bryngjones)
- [Jordan Grimmer](https://www.artstation.com/jordangrimmer)
- [Su Ke](https://www.artstation.com/sukeart)

The reason why it's beneficial to have some role model artists, is because you can purchase their brush bundles or even support them on patreon and relevant platforms so that you can get insight on how they work on their art.
