When starting painting or drawing in general, it is very common to get overwhelmed by the amount of detail of other's people work and most importantly the details you observe on your surroundings. 

You should try this out! Close your eyes till you can omit most of the details and everything appears dim, almost like a silhouette. Now the detail is gone. You can easily see the contrasts and shapes of the observed objects.

This is an ability that is hard to develop. When I first enrolled to art classes in high school, and I wanted to replicate an object synthesis, the first tip my art teacher mentioned to me was to squint my eyes as much as I can so that I can only see the silhouettes of the objects.
