To explore the concept of perspective and horizon, consider observing a table from different heights. When seated, your view of the table's surface is limited. Standing up offers a broader view of the tabletop. Crouching, however, not only provides a different angle of the same surface but reveals a portion of the table's underside. So, we can see how our viewpoint can significantly alter our perception of a single object. 

The horizon can be understood as the observer's eye level, serving as a fundamental element in perspective drawing. It is the point where all perspective lines converge, creating a sense of depth and dimension in the representation of space.

You can start observing by doing the exercise given at [Eye level](https://courses.byui.edu/art110_new/art110/week01/eye_level.html), don't get disappointed if you don't get them all correct.
